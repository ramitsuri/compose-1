# Pawper Finder

![Workflow result](https://github.com/ramitsuri/compose-1/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
A pet finder app written entirely in Compose. Also uses
- Retrofit
- Coil
- Coroutines


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Jetpack Compose changes how you think about Android UI entirely and I've started to become
comfortable with it only while figuring out things to complete this challenge.

Side note: this app has a repository class that can fetch real data from Petfinder API but since
the token provided with the free account has a very short duration, it's not fully wired up.
